(S) ynaptic Commands: Synaptic commands refer to the interconnections between the different parts of the game. ditaDucks
are able to interact with their environment through these actions that they have learned. Each action is performed in a
sequence that enables a ditaDuck to better support the overall goal of the gaggle. Synaptic commands can be designed and
developed from various components you will find throughout the game.

(O) rbital Sphere: All objects in SOUL:Emergent operate within an orbit. The closer they operate to this orbit the more
functional they remain. Objects outside of the orbit or ditaDucks that wandered outside the orbit will operate less
effectively. It will then be up to you to recover the ditaDuck or leave it to the CALIGINOUS.

(U) nified: When a system is operating at peak capacity, it is deemed to be UNIFIED. This is true for your gaggle as
well. When you are able to guide your ditaDucks to work cooperatively, the interconnected parts will become whole and
RADIATE. This will give a huge bonus to the efficiency of your LOGIC SYSTEM. Of course, only the ditaDucks within the
ORBITAL SPHERE will receive this benefit. The converse of this unification is a DIVERGENCE. If your LOGIC SYSTEM becomes
disarrayed everything will start falling apart. You’ll still be able to recover, but it won’t be easy!

    (L) ogic System: Each ditaDuck operates within an overall LOGIC SYSTEM that is governed by its ORIGINATOR. The
Originator issues tasks to the ditaDucks that the ditaDuck will either execute, if it has the capacity, or not execute,
because it lacks the SYNAPTIC COMMANDS. Then there’s the possibility that the ditaDuck will just ignore the task
request. That’s fun!
