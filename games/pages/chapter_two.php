                In Chapter 1 - <strong>GETTING STARTED</strong> you learned about the basics of <strong>SOUL:Emergent</strong>. You
                learned that it is a
                strategy game designed to test your skills guiding and evolving a new lifeform called a <strong>ditaDuck</strong>.
                You were given an
                overview of the game’s interface and learned how to interact with your <strong>ditaDuck</strong>. In this chapter,
                you will learn what
                <strong>SOUL</strong> stands for and be provided an explanation for each of its parts. You will then learn about
                <strong>EMERGENT</strong>
                gameplay and how it is a fundamental part of <strong>SOUL:Emergent</strong>. Then, you will learn about Sectors and
                Networks, which are
                how progress is measured through the game. Last, you will explore a scenario where you will see how
                <strong>EMERGENT</strong> game play
                can be useful in evolving strategies to repair a Sector and bridge two disconnected Networks to progress in the
                world of
                <strong>SOUL:Emergent</strong>.

                <strong>SOUL</strong> is an acronym that stands for <strong>SYNAPTIC ORBITAL UNIFICATION LOGIC</strong>. This
                acronym was designed to help define the different game play elements in <strong>SOUL:Emergent</strong>. Each part
                of <strong>SOUL</strong> relates to a different game play mechanic. The different mechanics are designed to
                seamlessly work with each other so that they make a whole. That is to say, not having access to a mechanic would
                be disastrous. Exploring each mechanic will enable you to systematically progress your way through the game world.
                The different mechanics will be discussed in the next section <a>UNDERSTANDING THE PARTS OF SOUL</a>.

                <h4>Objective</h4>
                <p>
                    It’s the year 2523, the first Actual Intelligence has emerged, known as the Glitch. It has infiltrated the Neural Net
                    which connects the minds of all living organisms. You have been tasked with developing a lifeform to combat this
                    Intelligence and keep the Neural Net from collapsing. You are an architect, a creator, an Originator. Originators are
                    selected from a special group of individuals to maintain the Neural Net. Humans developed the Neural Net to engineer
                    empathy and to enable global connection. What humans failed to see, was that same connection allowed The Glitch to
                    infect and spread fast. All biological lifeforms are at risk. Technology has evolved to the point where it can be used
                    to create lifeforms that inhabit organic bodies. As an Originator, use this technology to repair the Neural Net and
                    combat the invading AI. You must maintain the Neural net at all costs.
                </p>

                <h4>Starting a new campaign</h4>
                <p>
                    The first time you start a campaign, you will need to configure a prototype ditaDuck. The prototype you select will
                    define a base set of components for your ditaDuck. Remember that Components are what give your ditaDucks the ability to
                    respond to Synaptic Commands. Along with their Components, each prototype has a potential. Potentials give ditaDucks a
                    boost to certain characteristics and consequentially may reduce other characteristics. Potentials can be developed over
                    time by evolving your ditaDucks. Note that choosing a ditaDuck does not define your fate in SOUL:Emergent. Instead it
                    gives you a starting point and a trajectory. The AI Glitch has started affecting the Neural Net. It’s almost as if it’s
                    … rewriting the code. Throughout the campaign you will encounter abnormalities in the Neural Net. You may be able to use
                    these to your advantage.
                </p>

                <h4>Selecting your ditaDuck</h4>
                <p>
                    There are three different prototypes available to you when you first start the game. Those prototypes are Astir,
                    Bulwark, and Verdant. The Astir is represented by a triangle, the Bulwark is a square, and the Verdant is a circle.
                    Choosing your prototype ditaDuck

                    <ul style="list-style-type: none;;">
                        <li style="text-decoration: underline;">Astir</li>
                        <p>
                            The Astir is very fast and quick. This enhanced mobility enables it to move between locations quickly. What the Astir
                            gains in mobility, it lacks in preciseness. Astirs can be too quick to action and are prone to errors and
                            miscalculations.
                        </p>

                        <li style="text-decoration: underline;">Bulwark</li>
                        <p>
                            The Bulwark is steadfast and sturdy.
                        </p>

                        <li style="text-decoration: underline;">Verdant</li>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h4>Communicating with your ditaDucks</h4>
                <p>
                    Your Core is where you issue Synaptic Commands to your ditaDucks. Due to the way the Neural Net was constructed, these
                    commands are able to travel through connections and influence targets. However, the connections are limited in range.
                    That range is defined as your Orbital Sphere. The Orbital Sphere can be viewed on your screen as a circular highlight.
                    It can be toggled on or off. ditaDucks and other objects outside your Orbital sphere are shielded from your influence.
                    It is possible to expand your Orbital Sphere by constructing Relays. Relays are points of contact that receive and
                    retransmit Synaptic Commands. One a Relay is placed it will connect with your Core and increase the range of your
                    influence.
                </p>

                </p>

                <h4>Winning</h4>
                <p>
                    Keeping the Nuerual Net operational is the main objective of SOUL:Emergent. This is done by repairing sectors and
                    joining Networks. Once you repair a sector, a firewall will be installed by the Neural Net's operating system. This will
                    safeguard that sector from further intrusion. At this point, the Glitch is locked out. It is not required to join all networks.
                    However, joing networks does provide benefits during gameplay. Some of those benefits include: faster travel and bonuses
                    to your ditaDucks potentials.
                </p>
                <p>In order to win SOUL:Emergent all sectors must be repaired and <strong>The Glitch</strong> must be destroyed.</p>

            <h2 class="">SOUL Mechanics</h2>
            <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
            <p>
                Each SOUL MECHANIC is designed to incorporate different elements of SOUL:Emergent. Below is a description for each of
                those mechanics. As you play SOUL:Emergent you will find new ways to use each mechanic to your benefit. Keep in mind
                that the mechanics are only as efficient as its whole. If the whole system becomes overloaded and is screeching to a
                halt, then its parts will behave erratically.
            </p>

            <p>
                (S) ynaptic Commands: Synaptic commands refer to the interconnections between the different parts of the game. ditaDucks
                are able to interact with their environment through these actions that they have learned. Each action is performed in a
                sequence that enables a ditaDuck to better support the overall goal of the gaggle. Synaptic commands can be designed and
                developed from various components you will find throughout the game.
            </p>

            <p>
                (O) rbital Sphere: All objects in SOUL:Emergent operate within an orbit. The closer they operate to this orbit the more
                functional they remain. Objects outside of the orbit or ditaDucks that wandered outside the orbit will operate less
                effectively. It will then be up to you to recover the ditaDuck or leave it to the CALIGINOUS.
            </p>

            <p>
                (U) nified: When a system is operating at peak capacity, it is deemed to be UNIFIED. This is true for your gaggle as
                well. When you are able to guide your ditaDucks to work cooperatively, the interconnected parts will become whole and
                RADIATE. This will give a huge bonus to the efficiency of your LOGIC SYSTEM. Of course, only the ditaDucks within the
                ORBITAL SPHERE will receive this benefit. The converse of this unification is a DIVERGENCE. If your LOGIC SYSTEM becomes
                disarrayed everything will start falling apart. You’ll still be able to recover, but it won’t be easy!
            </p>
            <p>
                (L) ogic System: Each ditaDuck operates within an overall LOGIC SYSTEM that is governed by its ORIGINATOR. The
                Originator issues tasks to the ditaDucks that the ditaDuck will either execute, if it has the capacity, or not execute,
                because it lacks the SYNAPTIC COMMANDS. Then there’s the possibility that the ditaDuck will just ignore the task
                request. That’s fun!

                A great General once said, “Emerge and be VICTORIOUS!” While this may be true, SOUL:Emergent defines EMERGENT as much
                more. Emergence is a theme revisited throughout the entire game. You are given a box of tools and an objective. You use
                those tools how you see fit to achieve those means. That what Emergent means in SOUL:Emergent.

                <b>The Role of Emergent Gameplay in SOUL:Emergent</b>
                You have a set of tools. You have an objective. How do you meet your objective? That is a matter entirely up to you! Of
                course, you’ll be given some hints. In fact, you’ll be given a lesson on how you might attack your objective in the
                LEARNING TO PLAY SOUL:EMERGENT tutorials. You start off with a tiny ditaDuck. It is just coming to terms that it is
                alive. It knows how to consume CRUX.

                        Sectors: Sectors are areas in a NETWORK that need to be repaired. They could have a core that has fragmented, a
                        collection of segments that have faulted, and or a transit that has halted, and all while you are being assaulted. Yes,
                        there are fraudulent ditaDucks in each sector called Glitches. The GLITCHES have been attempting to hijack the Networks
